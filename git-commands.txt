Here is the step by step procedure:
1.) These are going to tell who are going to acess our code: 
git config --global user.name "Sam Smith"
git config --global user.email sam@example.com

2.)initializes git in the project:
git init

3.)add all the files in the project:
git add-A

4.)this helps us to take snapshots and commit changes:
git commit -m "Commit message"

5.)status-List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit:
git status

6.)mark the changed file:
git add <filename>
